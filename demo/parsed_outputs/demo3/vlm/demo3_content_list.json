Existing models for table understanding require linearization of the table structure, where row or column order is encoded as an unwanted bias. Such spurious biases make the model vulnerable to row and column order perturbations. Additionally, prior work has not thoroughly modeled the table structures or table-text alignments, hindering the table-text understanding ability. In this work, we propose a robust and structurally aware table-text encoding architecture TABLEFORMER, where tabular structural biases are incorporated completely through learnable attention biases. TABLEFORMER is (1) strictly invariant to row and column orders, and, (2) could understand tables better due to its tabular inductive biases. Our evaluations showed that TABLEFORMER outperforms strong baselines in all settings on SQA, WTQ and TABFACT table reasoning datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on SQA, especially when facing answer-invariant row and column order perturbations (6% improvement over the best baseline), because previous SOTA models' performance drops by 4% - 6% when facing such perturbations while TABLEFORMER is not affected.",

Also, tabular structures (e.g. same row information) are not fully incorporated to such models. Meanwhile, Yin et al. (2020) leveraged row encoder and column encoder sequentially, which introduced much computational overhead, thus requiring retrieving some rows as a preprocessing step. Finally, SAT (Zhang et al., 2020), Deng et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2021) restricted attention to same row or columns with attention mask, where such inductive bias is too strict that cells could not directly attend to those cells in different row and columns, hindering the modeling ability according to Table 5. Liu et al. (2021) used the seq2seq BART generation model with a standard Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. In all models mentioned above, spurious inter-cell order biases still exist due to global positional ids of Transformer, leading to the vulnerability to row or column order perturbations, while our TABLE-FORMER could avoid such problem. Mueller et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2020) also used relative positional encoding to encode table structures, but they modeled the relations as learnable relation vectors, whose large overhead prevented pretraining and led to poor performance without pretraining, similarly to ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020) explained in Section 3.",

To tackle this, we propose TABLEFORMER, where learnable task-independent learnable structural attention biases are introduced, while making it invariant to row/column order at the same time. Experimental results showed that TABLEFORMER outperforms strong baselines in 3 table reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA dataset, especially when facing row and column order perturbations, because of its invariance to row and column orders.",
