A method is presented that was specifically designed to operate on sequences of images. This method considers the cost of matching image points in both the spatial and temporal domain. To maintain real-time operation, a temporal cost aggregation method is used to evaluate the likelihood of matches that is invariant with respect to the number of prior images being considered. This method has been implemented on massively parallel GPU hardware, and the implementation ranks as one of the fastest and most accurate real-time stereo matching methods as measured by the Middlebury stereo performance benchmark."

Early proposed solutions to temporal stereo matching attempted to average matching costs across subsequent frames of a video sequence [13], [14]. Attempts have been made to integrate estimation of motion fields (optical flow) into temporal stereo matching. The methods of [15] and [16] perform smoothing of disparities along motion vectors recovered from the video sequence. The estimation of the motion field, however, prevents real-time implementation, since state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms do not, in general, approach real-time frame rates. In a related approach, Sizintsev and Wildes [17], [18] used steerable filters to obtain descriptors characterizing motion of image features in both space and time. Unlike traditional algorithms, their method performs matching on spatio-temporal motion descriptors, rather than on pure pixel intensity values, which leads to improved temporal coherence of disparity maps at the cost of reduced accuracy at depth discontinuities."

Although this method outperforms the baseline frame-to-frame approach, the amount of hardware memory necessary to construct the bilateral grid limits its application to single-channel, i.e., grayscale images only.

The operation of the algorithm has been divided into four stages: 1) two-pass spatial cost aggregation, 2) temporal cost aggregation, 3) disparity selection and confidence assessment, and 4) iterative disparity refinement. In the following, each of these stages is described in detail."

Still frames, however, are insufficient for evaluating stereo matching algorithms that incorporate frame-to-frame prediction to enhance matching accuracy. An alternative approach is to use a stereo video sequence with a ground truth disparity for each frame. Obtaining the ground truth disparity of real world video sequences is a difficult undertaking due to the high frame rate of video and limitations in depth sensing technology. To address the need for stereo video with ground truth disparities, five pairs of synthetic stereo video sequences of a computer-generated scene were given in [19]. While these videos incorporate a sufficient amount of movement variation, they were generated from relatively simple models using low-resolution rendering, and they do not provide occlusion or discontinuity maps."

This paper introduces an efficient temporal cost aggregation scheme that can easily be combined with conventional spatial cost aggregation to improve the accuracy of stereo matching when operating on video sequences. A synthetic video sequence, along with ground truth disparity data, was generated to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It was shown that temporal aggregation is significantly more robust to noise than a method that only considers the current stereo frames."
