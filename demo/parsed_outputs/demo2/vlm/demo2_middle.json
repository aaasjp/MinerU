A method is presented that was specifically designed to operate on sequences of images. This method considers the cost of matching image points in both the spatial and temporal domain. To maintain real-time operation, a temporal cost aggregation method is used to evaluate the likelihood of matches that is invariant with respect to the number of prior images being considered. This method has been implemented on massively parallel GPU hardware, and the implementation ranks as one of the fastest and most accurate real-time stereo matching methods as measured by the Middlebury stereo performance benchmark."

However, their application to stereo video sequences does not guarantee interframe consistency of matches extracted from subsequent stereo frame pairs. The lack of temporal consistency of matches between successive frames introduces spurious artifacts in the resulting disparity maps. The problem of obtaining temporally consistent sequences of disparity maps from video streams is known as the temporal stereo correspondence problem, yet the amount of research efforts oriented towards finding an effective solution to this problem is surprisingly small."

This method is invariant to the number of prior frames being considered, and can be easily incorporated into any local stereo method based on edge-aware filters. The iterative adaptive support matching algorithm presented in [3] serves as a foundation for the proposed method."

For visualization purposes, disparities recovered for every pixel of a reference image are stored together in the form of an image, which is known as the"

The minimization, however, is often achieved using iterative methods or graph cuts, which do not lend themselves well to parallel implementation."

In 2005, Yoon and Kweon [4] proposed an adaptive matching cost aggregation scheme, which assigns a weight value to every pixel located in the support window of a given pixel of interest. The weight value is based on the spatial and color similarity between the pixel of interest and a pixel in its support window, and the aggregated cost is computed as a weighted average of the pixel-wise costs within the considered support window. The edge-preserving nature and matching accuracy of adaptive support weights have made them one of the most popular choices for cost aggregation in recently proposed stereo matching algorithms [3], [5]-[8]."

In particular, the edge-aware image filters, such as the bilateral filter of Tomasi and Manducci [11] or the guided filter of He [12], have been rendered useful for the problem of matching cost aggregation, enabling stereo algorithms to correctly recover disparities along object boundaries. In fact, Yoon and Kweon's adaptive support-weight cost aggregation scheme is equivalent to the application of the so-called joint bilateral filter to the layers of the matching cost volume."

Early proposed solutions to temporal stereo matching attempted to average matching costs across subsequent frames of a video sequence [13], [14]. Attempts have been made to integrate estimation of motion fields (optical flow) into temporal stereo matching. The methods of [15] and [16] perform smoothing of disparities along motion vectors recovered from the video sequence. The estimation of the motion field, however, prevents real-time implementation, since state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms do not, in general, approach real-time frame rates. In a related approach, Sizintsev and Wildes [17], [18] used steerable filters to obtain descriptors characterizing motion of image features in both space and time. Unlike traditional algorithms, their method performs matching on spatio-temporal motion descriptors, rather than on pure pixel intensity values, which leads to improved temporal coherence of disparity maps at the cost of reduced accuracy at depth discontinuities."

Still frames, however, are insufficient for evaluating stereo matching algorithms that incorporate frame-to-frame prediction to enhance matching accuracy. An alternative approach is to use a stereo video sequence with a ground truth disparity for each frame. Obtaining the ground truth disparity of real world video sequences is a difficult undertaking due to the high frame rate of video and limitations in depth sensing technology. To address the need for stereo video with ground truth disparities, five pairs of synthetic stereo video sequences of a computer-generated scene were given in [19]. While these videos incorporate a sufficient amount of movement variation, they were generated from relatively simple models using low-resolution rendering, and they do not provide occlusion or discontinuity maps."

This paper introduces an efficient temporal cost aggregation scheme that can easily be combined with conventional spatial cost aggregation to improve the accuracy of stereo matching when operating on video sequences. A synthetic video sequence, along with ground truth disparity data, was generated to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It was shown that temporal aggregation is significantly more robust to noise than a method that only considers the current stereo frames."
