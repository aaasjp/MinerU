A method is presented that was specifically designed to operate on sequences of images. This method considers the cost of matching image points in both the spatial and temporal domain. To maintain real-time operation, a temporal cost aggregation method is used to evaluate the likelihood of matches that is invariant with respect to the number of prior images being considered. This method has been implemented on massively parallel GPU hardware, and the implementation ranks as one of the fastest and most accurate real-time stereo matching methods as measured by the Middlebury stereo performance benchmark.

It is assumed that the stereo images are rectified, such that matching pixels are confined within corresponding rows of the images and thus disparities are restricted to the horizontal dimension, as illustrated in Figure 1. For visualization purposes, disparities recovered for every pixel of a reference image are stored together in the form of an image, which is known as the disparity map. Note that individual disparities can be converted to actual depths if the geometry of the camera setup is known, i.e., the stereo configuration of cameras has been precalibrated. ",

In 2005, Yoon and Kweon [4] proposed an adaptive matching cost aggregation scheme, which assigns a weight value to every pixel located in the support window of a given pixel of interest. The weight value is based on the spatial and color similarity between the pixel of interest and a pixel in its support window, and the aggregated cost is computed as a weighted average of the pixel-wise costs within the considered support window. The edge-preserving nature and matching accuracy of adaptive support weights have made them one of the most popular choices for cost aggregation in recently proposed stereo matching algorithms [3], [5]–[8].

Early proposed solutions to temporal stereo matching attempted to average matching costs across subsequent frames of a video sequence [13], [14]. Attempts have been made to integrate estimation of motion fields (optical flow) into temporal stereo matching. The methods of [15] and [16] perform smoothing of disparities along motion vectors recovered from the video sequence. The estimation of the motion field, however, prevents real-time implementation, since state-of-the-art optical flow algorithms do not, in general, approach real-time frame rates. In a related approach, Sizintsev and Wildes [17], [18] used steerable filters to obtain descriptors characterizing motion of image features in both space and time. Unlike traditional algorithms, their method performs matching on spatio-temporal motion descriptors, rather than on pure pixel intensity values, which leads to improved temporal coherence of disparity maps at the cost of reduced accuracy at depth discontinuities.

Although this method outperforms the baseline frame-to-frame approach, the amount of hardware memory necessary to construct the bilateral grid limits its application to single-channel, i.e., grayscale images only. Hosni et al. [10], on the other hand, reformulated kernels of the guided image filter to operate on both spatial and temporal information, making it possible to process a temporal collection of cost volumes. The filtering operation was shown to preserve spatio-temporal edges present in the cost volumes, resulting in increased temporal consistency of disparity maps, greater robustness to image noise, and more accurate behavior around object boundaries.

Still frames, however, are insufficient for evaluating stereo matching algorithms that incorporate frame-to-frame prediction to enhance matching accuracy. An alternative approach is to use a stereo video sequence with a ground truth disparity for each frame. Obtaining the ground truth disparity of real world video sequences is a difficult undertaking due to the high frame rate of video and limitations in depth sensingtechnology. To address the need for stereo video with ground truth disparities, five pairs of synthetic stereo video sequences of a computer-generated scene were given in [19]. While these videos incorporate a sufficient amount of movement variation, they were generated from relatively simple models using lowresolution rendering, and they do not provide occlusion or discontinuity maps.

Realistic material properties were used to give surfaces a natural-looking appearance by adjusting their specularity, reflectance, and diffusion. The video sequence has a resolution of $6 4 0 ~ \\times ~ 4 8 0$ pixels, a frame rate of 30 frames per second, and a duration of 4 seconds. In addition to performing photorealistic rendering, depth renders of both video sequences were also generated and converted to ground truth disparity for the stereo video. The video sequences and ground truth data have been made available at http://mc2.unl.edu/current-research /image-processing/.

This paper introduces an efficient temporal cost aggregation scheme that can easily be combined with conventional spatial cost aggregation to improve the accuracy of stereo matching when operating on video sequences. A synthetic video sequence, along with ground truth disparity data, was generated to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It was shown that temporal aggregation is significantly more robust to noise than a method that only considers the current stereo frames. ",

Figure 4 shows the optimal values of $\\lambda$ for noise ranging between $\\pm 0$ to $\\pm 4 0$ . As intuition would suggest, it is more beneficial to rely on the auxiliary cost when noise is high and it is more beneficial to rely on the current cost when noise is low. Figure 5 illustrates the improvements that are achieved when applying temporal stereo matching to a particular pair of frames in the synthetic video sequence. Clearly, the noise in the disparity map is drastically reduced when temporal stereo matching is used. ",
